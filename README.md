Instructions (w/o markdown):

1. Create account at eternalwarcry.com, goto "Menu"->
    "Collection" -> "Browse Collection" ->

2. Sort by Owned cards

3. Goto Collection options, and select "Add by rarity"
  3a. Add All uncommon and common cards this way.

4. Next open Eternal on a PC through steam and create a deck with
    rares/promo's/legendaries sorted by EACH COLOR.
    IMPORTANT: Get the COUNT of cards for most accurate settings.
      Will most likely have a "fill-in-all-4" setting that makes it so users can/only have to select each card one time. My thought process is the more unique information, the better.
      4a. I found it helpful and useful to start from left to right when
      filtering each color, and ignoring mixed color cards that have been added ON THE LEFT. (if that makes any sense)

5. Export every deck of each color from Eternal and import into collection on
    EternalWarcry.com
